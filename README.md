# AIxB Landing Page

## Content Management

The content directory houses all of the content for the landing page, with each file corresponding to a section. The content is formatted using mdx, and utilizes [markdown formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). To update, add, or remove content, branch off of the `main` branch and name your branch `content/[date]` . When all your content has been updated, create a Pull Request to merge your content branch into main. If there is a time-sensitive update needed, please note this timeline or deadline in your PR description. Request one of the following people [Suejin Kim, Matt Watson, or David Glymph] as a reviewer. One of these team members will review the content to ensure the formatting is compatible and error-free, and will merge the content after reviewing.
